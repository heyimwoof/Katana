# Katana

**Katana, a .NET obfuscator by woof**
* I don't take credit for the methods used in the obfuscator, most of them are public. I just decided to put it all together since there isn't many .NET obfuscators available for free + rainbow UI is awesome.

**What's included?**
- Keyauth API, it'll include auto updates.
- Constants protection
- Anti Debug
- Mutation
- Control Flow
- Anti Dump
- Junk Spam
- Reference Proxy
- Watermark
- Renamer
- Methods Encryption
- Anti de4dot
- Fake Attributes
- Anti crack
- Rainbow UI


**Things to consider**
- I don't take credit for all the methods used in the obfuscator, most of them are public. I just decided to put it all together since there isn't many good .NET obfuscators available for free.
- This project will become open source eventually.
